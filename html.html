      <h1>SAMBOTO</h1> 
        <h3>Iisang Boto para sa Pagbabago</h3>
      <p>The Samboto (Isang Boto para sa Pagbabago) movement was created to address the immediate need for responsible voting and to empower every Filipino to make a difference in the country's future. We want to address the real issues that lead to poverty and corruption in the Philippines by encouraging individuals to register to vote and cast votes with knowledge and awareness.</p> 
      <p>With 68.6 million registered voters (Manalo, 2024) and a population of over 120 million in 2025 (Macrotrends, 2025), every Filipino must use their right to vote. About 20 million of the registered voters are members of the Gen Z age (Serquiña, 2024), which has a 98% literacy rate and is a highly literate group (Trading Economics, 2025). This generation can determine the future, and they can have a big impact on the country's course if they register to vote. This movement seeks to improve voter awareness for the younger generations, as many people still fail to fully understand the significance of their vote.</p>
      <p>Even though the nation has a high literacy rate, political dynasties, corruption, and poor governance still impede development. Millions of Filipinos, including 32 million children, were living below the poverty line in 2023 when the country's poverty rate was 15.5% (Wikipedia, 2025). Compared to other countries, the prevalence of political dynasties and subpar leadership has caused poverty to drop more slowly, and many people are still living in rural areas that are susceptible to natural disasters, which makes poverty even worse.</p>
      <p>The Samboto movement encourages Filipinos to select leaders dedicated to transparency, integrity, and the well-being of the people, as it acknowledges the ability of every voter's vote to produce positive change. We can end the corruption cycle, enhance governance, and build a more prosperous future for the country by casting informed ballots. By working together, we can change things and make sure that our opinions are heard in every election, improving the Philippines for the coming generations.</p>
